FYI: OpenCV is only used for image aquisition and preprocessing steps. The core routines are written in  C/C++. 
The readability of the code will be improved soon !

## LitterDetection

This a program for Litter detection events in video surveillance. An object (of any type) is detected secondes after
its owner has left it in the camera FOV. The algorithm is an improved version of the algorithm  we first proposed  in :

[**Ilias, D. A. H. I., et al. "An edge-based method for effective abandoned luggage detection in complex surveillance videos." Computer Vision and Image Understanding 158 (2017): 141-151.**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314217300243)
